# Restatement of the Problem

To analyze the advantages and disadvantages of species altering sex ratios based on resource availability and gain deeper insights into the interactions generated within ecosystems, our developed model achieves the following:
1.     Accounts for the impact of seven-gill shark populations on other organisms within the ecosystem
2.     Considers how the sex ratio of seven-gill sharks is influenced by environmental factors
3.     Examines the specific mechanisms through which seven-gill sharks affect ecosystem stability

# Our work

1. Developed a multidimensional predator-prey model (Model I) based on Lokta-Volterra
differential equations, considering the predation effects of predators on multiple
prey and the competitive effects among prey.
2. Divided the ecosystem into abiotic and biotic factors and used Model I to address
the impact of variable sea lamprey sex ratios on the population of its main prey,
explaining how it affects the larger ecosystem.
3. Developed an individual growth rate and classifier model for sea lampreys (Model
II), considering the effects of resource availability and water temperature on the
growth enzyme activity within lampreys and deriving a growth rate-environmental
factor model as an intermediary. Classified the growth rate indicators based on
resource availability to determine how growth rate influences the sex ratio of sea
lamprey populations.
4. Applied Model II to address how individual lamprey sex changes with variable
resource availability and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of variable sex
ratio in sea lamprey populations.
5. Developed an ecosystem stability model (Model III), using cellular automata to sim-
ulate the specific impact of sea lamprey populations on the ecosystem and construct-
ing the relationship between ecosystem stability and multiple important environ-
mental indicators using the AHP hierarchical analysis method.
6. Applied Model III to explain how sea lamprey populations with variable sex ratios
affect ecosystem stability.
7. Developed a parasite fluctuation model (Model IV), dividing parasites into those
parasitizing sea lamprey populations and those parasitizing other populations, and
demonstrating their impact through differential equations to explain whether sea
lamprey populations can provide advantages for other organisms.
